# The Best Clustering Algorithms in Data Mining

### 1. Summary of the paper:

The paper discusses several clustering algorithms, including K-Means algorithm, K-Medoids, Distributed K-Means clustering algorithm, Hierarchical clustering algorithm, Grid-based Algorithm and Density based clustering algorithm, with biasc ideas, advantages and disadvantage discussed. And briefly introduces three normalization approaches. However, this paper is not very comprehensive and its structure is not so clear. Some section seems to have not been completed yet. Regarding this paper as someone's learning journal may be the best way to read it.

### 2. Data normalization

### 3. Some points of view
- K-means has the ability to deal with large amount of data and its performance increases as the number of clusters increases.
- Density based clustering is the most popular data mining algorithm (paper published in 2016). 
- Density based clustering is not appropriate for datasets that have great variance in density, but it is a good choice for data with arbitrary shapes.
